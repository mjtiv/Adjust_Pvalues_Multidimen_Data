Adjusting Pvalues for Multidimensional Data 

PROGRAM: Multidimensional p-value Corrector

DESCRIPTION: Program takes in a multi-dimensional dataset (see example file)
and begins correcting p-values across the entire dataset, taking into account
the multidimensial directionality of the data, so individual sample p-values for
a specific variant can be examined for significance. 

Program Based on the Paper:

Decisions, with Applications to Gene Expression Data
